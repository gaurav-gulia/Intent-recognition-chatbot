## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an intent recognition system capable of accurately understanding user intents conveyed through natural language input. The system should be able to classify user queries or commands into predefined categories or intents, enabling effective interaction between users and the system.

## Scope
Develop a natural language processing (NLP) model capable of processing textual input.
Define a set of intents relevant to the domain of application (e.g., customer service, virtual assistants, etc.).
Collect and pre-process a diverse dataset of user queries or commands annotated with their corresponding intents for training and evaluation.
Train and fine-tune the intent recognition model using machine learning techniques, deep learning
